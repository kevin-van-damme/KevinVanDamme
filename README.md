Well hello there,
Thank you for checking out my page!

My name is Kevin, and this is my journey on the way to becoming a Full Stack Dev.

Not having a programming background makes it a bit harder to grasp the logic behind Js. But by going over each class everyday helps me completely understand the reasoning behind the syntax, stringMethods, Functions, Loops and how math works inside Js. I'm trying to focus on how developers need to think about a certain problem that needs fixing, how to go about finding the right solution for this problem and how this solution can be used for different scenarios. It is really amazing how people take everthing that is developed by humans for granted. Not understanding or appreciating how much time and effort has gone into developing something that makes life easier for billions around the world. I can't wait to see how my thinking, reasoning will change while taking this course. 

// Log.20241004 // The first two weeks have almost passed. When I look into my garden from the kitchen window, all I see is code. Thinking over and over how this specific syntax solves a very small problem or request. Step by step i'm starting to make it my own. Improving myself by repeating many different exercises that our teachers have given us. I am so happy that i'm taking this course so seriously. This isn't the same with everyone else in class. There are some who have a programming background which makes the introduction of this course look like breeze, a refresher of sorts. While others are making jokes, laughing around and often ask questions that shouldn't be asked at this time in the course. I think that the purging has begun. The teacher made a joke about it the other day bacause some were late in class. People where laughing, while others weren't. They knew that behind that joke was a spark of truth. Which made me shift gears and study even more. The pace of Js is crazy, it goes so fast that I don't have time to fully grasp each item being discussed. PHP and MySQL are being taught at a very pleasant pace, fast enough, but the time in between excerises gives you a moment to catch a breather and let all the new information nest in the grey mass we call brain.
